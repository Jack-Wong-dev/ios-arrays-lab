## Question 1

Create an array of strings called `colors` that contain "orange", "red", "yellow", "turquoise", and "lavender".

Then, using array subscripting and string interpolation, print out the String `"orange, yellow, and lavender are some of my favorite colors"`.

```
swift
//Q1
var colors = ["orange","red","yellow","turquoise","lavender"]

print("\(colors[0]), \(colors[2]), and \(colors[4]) are some of my favorite colors")
```

## Question 2

Remove "Illinois" and "Kansas" from the array below.

`var westernStates = ["California", "Oregon", "Washington", "Idaho", "Illinois", "Kansas"]`

```
swift
//Q2
var westernStates = ["California", "Oregon", "Washington", "Idaho", "Illinois", "Kansas"]

westernStates.remove(at: 4)
westernStates.remove(at: westernStates.count-1)
```


## Question 3

Iterate through the array below. For each state, print out the name of the state, a colon, and whether it is or is not **in the continental United States.**

`let moreStates = ["Hawaii", "New Mexico", "Alaska", "Montana", "Texas", "New York", "Florida"]`

```
swift
//Q3
let moreStates = ["Hawaii", "New Mexico", "Alaska", "Montana", "Texas", "New York", "Florida"]

for state in moreStates{
    if(state == "Hawaii"){
        print("\(state) is not in the continential United States")}
    else{
        print("\(state) is in the continential United States")
    }
}
```

## Question 4

Print out how many non-whitespace characters are in `myString`:

`let myString = "This is good practice with Strings!"`

Iterate through the array below. For each sentence, print out how many non-whitespace characters are in it.

`let myFavoriteQuotes = ["To be or not to be, that is the question.", "The only source of knowledge is experience.", "Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall!", "Four score and twenty years ago..."]`

```
swift
//Q4
let myFavoriteQuotes = ["To be or not to be, that is the question.", "The only source of knowledge is experience.", "Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall!", "Four score and twenty years ago..."]

var counter = 0

for i in myFavoriteQuotes{
    for j in i{
        if j != " "{counter+=1}
    }
}
print(counter)
```




## Question 5

Iterate through `garden` and place any ðŸŒ· that you find into the `basket`. Replace any ðŸŒ· that you pick up with `"dirt"`. Then print how many ðŸŒ· are in your `basket`.

```swift
var garden = ["dirt","ðŸŒ·","dirt","ðŸŒ·","dirt","dirt","ðŸŒ·","dirt","ðŸŒ·","dirt"]
var basket = [String]()
```
```
swift
//Q5
var index = 0
var garden = ["dirt","ðŸŒ·","dirt","ðŸŒ·","dirt","dirt","ðŸŒ·","dirt","ðŸŒ·","dirt"]
var basket = [String]()

for i in garden{
    if i == "\u{1F337}"{
        basket.append("\u{1F337}")
        garden[index] = "dirt"
    }
    index += 1
}
print(garden)
```

## Question 6

The below array represents an unfinished batting lineup for a baseball team. **You, the coach,** need to make some last minute changes:

- Add "Suzuki" to the end of your lineup.
- Change "Jeter" to "Tejada".
- Change "Thomas" for "Guerrero"
- Put "Reyes" to bat 8th instead.

`var battingLineup = ["Reyes", "Jeter", "Ramirez", "Pujols","Griffey","Thomas","Jones", "Rodriguez"]`

```
var battingLineup = ["Reyes", "Jeter", "Ramirez", "Pujols","Griffey","Thomas","Jones", "Rodriguez"]

battingLineup.append("Suzuki")
battingLineup[1] = "Tejada"
battingLineup[5] = "Guerrero"
battingLineup.remove(at: 0)
battingLineup.append("Reyes")
```


## Question 7

Given an array of Ints, find out if it contains a target number.  

(The built-in `contains(_:)` function will do this, but you aren't allowed to use it for this exercise.)


```swift
var numbers: [Int]

let target: Int = 32
```

Ex.1

```swift
numbers = [4,2,6,73,32,4,2,1]

target = 32

//true
```



Ex. 2

```swift
numbers = [32459,2,4,5,1,4,2,1]

target = 3

//false
```
```
//Q7
var target = 32
var answer: Bool = false


for num in numbers{
    if num == target{
        answer = true
        break        
    }else{
        answer = false
    }
}

print(answer)
```


## Question 8

Find the largest value in an array of Int.  Do not use the built-in `max()` method.

```swift
let arrayOfNumbers: [Int] = (1...100).map{ _ in Int.random(in: 0...200)}.map{Int($0)}

//This creates an array of 100 numbers in between 0 and 200.  For now, you don't need to worry about how it does that.
```
```
swift
//Q8 Solution
let arrayOfNumbers: [Int] = (1...100).map{ _ in Int.random(in: 0...200)}.map{Int($0)}

let newArray = arrayOfNumbers.sorted()
print(newArray[newArray.count-1])

```


## Question 9

Find the smallest value in an array of Int.  Do not use the built in min() method.

```swift
let arrayOfNumbers: [Int] = (1...100).map{ _ in Int.random(in: 0...200)}.map{Int($0)}

//This creates an array of 100 numbers in between 0 and 200.  For now, you don't need to worry about how it does that.
```
```
swift
//Q9
let arrayOfNumbers: [Int] = (1...100).map{ _ in Int.random(in: 0...200)}.map{Int($0)}

let newArray = arrayOfNumbers.sorted()
print(newArray[0])

```


## Question 10

Iterate through `secondListOfNumbers`, and print out all the odd numbers.

`var secondListOfNumbers = [19,13,14,19,101,10000,141,404]`

```
swift
//Q10
var secondListOfNumbers = [19,13,14,19,101,10000,141,404]

for i in secondListOfNumbers where i % 2 != 0 {print(i, separator: "", terminator: " ")}
```


## Question 11

Iterate through `thirdListOfNumbers`, and print out the sum.

`var thirdListOfNumbers = [11, 26, 49, 61, 25, 40, 74, 3, 22, 23]`

```
swift
//Q11
var thirdListOfNumbers = [11, 26, 49, 61, 25, 40, 74, 3, 22, 23]
var sum = 0

for i in thirdListOfNumbers{sum += i}; print(sum)

```


## Question 12

Iterate through `thirdListOfNumbers`, and print out the sum of all the even numbers.

`var thirdListOfNumbers = [11, 26, 49, 61, 25, 40, 74, 3, 22, 23]`
```
swift
//Q12
var thirdListOfNumbers = [11, 26, 49, 61, 25, 40, 74, 3, 22, 23]
var evenSum = 0

for i in thirdListOfNumbers where i % 2 == 0{evenSum += i};print(evenSum)
```


## Question 13

Append every Int that appears in both `listOne` and `listTwo` to the `sharedElements` array. Then print **how many Ints** are shared.

```swift
var listOne = [28, 64, 7, 96, 13, 32, 94, 11, 80, 68]
var listTwo = [18, 94, 48, 6, 42, 68, 79, 76, 13, 7]
var sharedElements = [Int]()
```
```
//Q13
var listOne = [28, 64, 7, 96, 13, 32, 94, 11, 80, 68]
var listTwo = [18, 94, 48, 6, 42, 68, 79, 76, 13, 7]
var sharedElements = [Int]()

for i in listOne{
if listTwo.contains(i){
sharedElements.append(i)}
}

for j in sharedElements{print(j, separator: "", terminator: " ")}

```


## Question 14

Write code such that `noDupeList` has all the same Ints as `dupeFriendlyList`, but has no more than one of each Int.

```swift
var dupeFriendlyList = [4,2,6,2,2,6,4,9,2,1]
var noDupeList: [Int] = []
```
```
swift
//Q14
var dupeFriendlyList = [4,2,6,2,2,6,4,9,2,1]
var noDupeList: [Int] = []

for i in dupeFriendlyList{
if !(noDupeList.contains(i)){noDupeList.append(i)}
}

for j in noDupeList {print(j, separator: "", terminator: " ")}

```

```
swift
//Q15
let arrayOfNumbers: [Int] = (1...10).map{ _ in Int.random(in: 0...200)}.map{Int($0)}

var sortedArrayOfNumbers = arrayOfNumbers.sorted()

var secondSmallest = sortedArrayOfNumbers[0]

for i in sortedArrayOfNumbers{
if(secondSmallest > i){ secondSmallest = i}
}; print(secondSmallest)
```

## Question 16

If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.

```
swift
let range = 0...1000

sum += i
}; print(sum)
```

//compare the sum of all possible triplets

for i in 0..<tripleSumArr.count - 2{
    for j in 1+i..<tripleSumArr.count - 1{
        for k in 2+j..<tripleSumArr.count{
            if (tripleSumArr[i] + tripleSumArr[j] + tripleSumArr[k]) == sum{
